Star Wars
Kenner. 1978-85. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 9. Figures: 104.
-----------------------------------------------
All figures feature solid construction.

Some figures were re-issued in The Power of the Force series with additional collector's coins, but otherwise are identical to previous releases. Several coins were issued for vehicles or cast ensembles, and not listed here. Although there are 4 distinct R2-D2 figures in the line, only 1 coin was issued (with the pop-up lightsaber version). All coins for the original Kenner 78-85 line are silver.

Both the A-Wing Pilot and Boba Fett were included in the figure assortment for Star Wars: Droids, and I've added a note that they have different collector's coins issued. In addition, there were new Droids coins issued for those versions of C-3PO and R2-D2.

Coins are listed next to the figure's first release.

Accessories that are unique to a single figure are marked with (U).

Figures that came with a playset are marked, but not all have been listed.

Major figure variations are listed under the figure's entry, and aren't counted towards the figure total above.
