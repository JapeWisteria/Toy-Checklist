Film Storybooks
-----------------------------------------------
These books were loosely published between multiple publishers and imprints, starting in 1977 with the Star Wars Storybook. They were often issued in both hardcover and trade paperback, and were magazine-sized.

They were a combination of retelling the film in prose and still photographs from the film, sometimes incorporating deleted scenes and details from novelizations and early script drafts.
