Doctor Who
Dapol. 1988-2002. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 1. Figures: 76.
-----------------------------------------------

All figures featured solid construction. Several had no articulation, and were figurines. A large amount of daleks had a pull-back friction motor.

Figures were released in only a few waves. The bulk of the figures and variants are store exclusives or tied to an event (ie, Christmas or anniversaries). Because figures were released so often and in so many variations, I'm listing the figures as a single wave.

Only a few figures had accessories.
