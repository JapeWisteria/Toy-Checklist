Mego. 1976-81. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 5. Figures: 35.
-----------------------------------------------
Mego licensed several different toy lines from Japan and released them under the same banner with a new back story, similar to what Hasbro did with The Transformers line in the 1980's. The result is a toy line with figures in multiple scales and mold types. For the last few waves, Mego released their own designs along with Japanese molds.

Only the 3.75" figures are listed, along with their accessories. The mold type is listed next to the figure.

The last wave was mostly distributed in Italy.
