Funko. 2014-2017. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: ?. Figures: ?.
-----------------------------------------------
All figures have solid construction.

Reaction figures are made to resemble vintage 70s 5 POA figures, but are based on both modern and vintage movie and television franchises. Funko started the line in 2014, and the brand was transferred to Super7 in 2018. This list only covers Funko-issued Reaction figures.

Because Reaction has so many sub-lines, the list is organized in this way, alphabetically by franchise.
