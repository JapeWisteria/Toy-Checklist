Starlog Photo Guidebooks
-----------------------------------------------
Starlog Magazine special perfect-bound guidebooks during the 1970's and 1980's covering a variety of science-fiction topics.

There were never any follow-up volumes for the Toys & Models or Weapons Guidebooks. There have been ads for a deluxe edition of the Space Art book I haven't been able to verify.
