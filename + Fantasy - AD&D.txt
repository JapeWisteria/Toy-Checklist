Waves: 2. Figures: 26.
-----------------------------------------------
All figures have solid construction. All 'shield shooter' (SS) figures had a shield with a removable part, but was based on the original mold for the solid shield when the figure was released earlier. All 'battle-matic' (BM) figures were re-issues of figures from the first wave with an action feature built into them.
