-----------------------------------------------
Play People were similar in design and function to Fisher-Price Adventure People: figures that based on adult occupations and activities, often shipped with vehicles or playsets. Tonka often applied the Tonka logo onto figures.

Tonka offered a smaller figure selection, often re-issuing a figure in different coloured plastic multiple times to reflect different occupations. They also partnered with professional racers and other companies to offer branded toys.

Figures below are organized by general body type, then by occupation and colour combinations.
