Star Wars: The Power of The Force 2
Hasbro\Kenner. 1995-2000. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 6. Figures: 224.
-----------------------------------------------
All figures feature solid construction.

Hasbro bought Kenner prior to releasing this line, and initially marketed it under that brand. Because Kenner released the last 2 waves of Star Wars figures under the name "The Power of The Force" after Return of the Jedi was released, but this line has the same name, it is referred to by collectors as "The Power of The Force 2".

The Power of The Force 2 contains the first figures of characters introduced in the Special Edition edits of the original trilogy, as well as figures based on production concepts and Expanded Universe/Legends content. It also contained the first figures released for The Phantom Menace.

Hasbro didn't release figures in traditional waves, instead releasing figures on different cardbacks or in sets (movie scenes, non-canon accessories, or with vehicles). The figures below are listed by year then sub-group, with each year as a wave.

The same figure would often be released multiple times with different packaging. If the accessories are different, this is noted.

There was a re-release on launch of 4 classic Kenner figures from the 1978-85 line: Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Han Solo (1978) and Luke Skywalker (Tatooine). The copyright stamp is different on these figures. They aren't listed here.

As the line progressed, Commtech Chips were introduced, which would speak lines of dialogue when combined with a reader device (sold seperately). There were also "freeze frames", film cells that could be partially animated. These aren't listed, as many figures were issued with or without them.

In addition, Hasbro released many premium figures, exclusives, mail-aways and limited releases. These are listed at the end.
