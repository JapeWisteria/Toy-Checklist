Adventure People
Fisher Price. 1975-1985. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 11. Figures: 77.
-----------------------------------------------
The Adventure People line was created by Fisher-Price to be educational toys, designed to appeal to both girls and boys. Information on the line is spotty, but collectors generally agree that the line started sometime in 1975-76 and ended around 1985.

The figures were often distributed first with vehicles, play environments, or carded with accessories designed to emulate a specific occupation or adult activity (jungle safari, paramedic rescue, civilian pilot, deep sea divers, etc). Because the same figures could be packaged with different accessories depending on theme, they are not listed here.

Because figures were often re-released with different accessories and different paint jobs, I'm listing each year as an individual wave above, but not listing figures by year below.

Later in the line's development, figures were released on their own without accessories on 2 types of cards: a generic tan card, and a larger illustrated card.

Adventure People often re-used existing pieces in different combinations and colours.

Several figures have been found by collectors for which no information exists. They are believed to be prototypes or internal company rewards/experiments, and aren't listed here.

All figures featured solid construction.

I've organized the figures below into broad categories.
