Beater, Loose, Incomplete: A Partial Checklist for 1:18 Scale Vintage and Modern Action Figures

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------
It all started with Bossk, as things often do.

Back in 2016, while rummaging around in Value Village (Savers in the US, a for-profit thrift chain modelled after Goodwill and The Salvation Army), I wandered to the toy aisle and found a vintage Kenner Bossk hiding in a bag of random toys. Price: $4. On a whim, I picked him up.

It triggered a memory. Before the Pantages theater in Toronto was restored, it spent time in the 70s and 80s as a movie theater called The Imperial Six. I saw many, many childhood favorites there: Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, most of the Indy films...my first Bond (For Your Eyes Only). I get why it was restored to a live performance venue, but I _really_ miss that movie theater.

My brother (much older and living in Calgary) was paying us a visit, and with my mom, we all went downtown to see The Raiders of the Lost Ark at The Imperial Six. Beside the theater is The Eaton Center, one of Toronto's largest malls, anchored at the time by 2 now-defunct department stores: Simpson's at one end and Eaton's at the other. So we ate at the food court and shopped to while away the time before the show.

Of course, I wanted to see the toy departments. During his visit, my brother bought me a Dengar, and my mom bought me a Fast 111's (a die-cast car line whose gimmick was randomized license plates...no 2 were alike, they claimed).

It was a good day. And while Bossk isn't Dengar, it got me thinking about all of the many, many toys I had in childhood, and some of the more vivid memories I had of stores, birthdays, holidays, and weird happenstances that contributed to that collection.

My mom was Kondo before Kondo was even alive, so all my childhood toys were eventually purged by my early teens. I was given a choice: my comics or my toys...one had to go. I chose comics.

While I don't regret that decision, it was brutal to find out how much some of the things I had as a kid are worth now.

Bossk kicked off an adventure that's lasted 7 years. During that time, I've had to accept that some things are beyond my reach, but there's always the "beater bins", buckets of treasure waiting to be rescued, restored, and loved again.

When I started this trip in 2016, I made a promise to myself: only buy what you love, buy as low as you can (even if that means getting beaters), and buy loose. Toys are meant to be played with and handled. While "play" at my age means display cases, it's still play.

Going through thrift shops, toy shows, conventions, and all the various ways to re-acquire my childhood, I inevitably bought things I already owned. I knew I needed a better solution than my crusty memory if I wanted to avoid that in the future.

Enter the genesis for this book. It started with a small list of toylines and grew, and grew, and grew...and _really_ grew. I had to draw a line in the sand somewhere, and this is it. Maybe someday I'll have a complete list, but not today.

You'll notice that this book almost exclusively covers 1:18 scale figures, or 3.75" (9.525 cm for the Metric crowd). I had a few Transformers and some figures in other scales, but I fell in love with 3.75 early. It was the perfect size to fit into pockets and pencil cases, smuggling them out of the house for recess, trips, and after-school adventures.

While many other scales had figures available from multiple franchises, the overwhelming variety of genres available to a kid in 3.75 from the mid-70s to the mid-90s was staggering. Zorro could fence with Vader. Han could hang out with Batman. Starbuck and Luke could hang out on The Love Boat. It was fertile ground for a kid's imagination...we really didn't worry about copyright and studio rights in our backyards.

Of course I'll never own all all of these. I doubt I'll get past a quarter of this list. It's been exhausting compiling all of this information, but worth it for the joy of digging through websites, old books, and having my memory jogged by all of these wonderful toys.

Enjoy the book.

Preface
-----------------------------------------------

Preamble
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This list comprises over 2,000 action figures and their accessories, across over 75 distinct lines from almost 40 companies, from 1975 to 2021. It doesn't include playsets, vehicles, and associated merchandise.

It's organized by broad categories, such as Horror, Science Fiction, Film & TV, etc. A few of the larger franchises are broken out into their own categories.

After the figures, I've listed out merchadise that's closely tied to the toy lines that I collect, like trading cards, mini-comics, View Master reels, etc.

How to Use This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Table of Contents lists all toy lines covered in this volume.

There is an index covering toy lines, their manufacturers, media associated with the toy line (if any), and live-action actors who portrayed the roles the toys are based on. There's also an extensive index covering G.I. Joe characters, their first comic appearances, and how many figures were made of each character.

Conventions Used in This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the toy lines contain their own introductions, detailing the decisions I made on how to document the line and any quirks that line has.

Trooper - an army-builder figure that isn't any specific character.

Actor(s) - if a figure was based on a live-action property, the actor or actors playing the role (including voice actors) are included.

Acknowledgments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This book rests on the laurels of research done by many different collectors, collector communities, and public databases and websites. Mentioning them all would be too long a list. I've added a list of primary links and books in the bibliography.

I'd like to thank all the groups who did pain-staking research, and released that information to the public. This book is my own personal distillation of that, based on my own collecting preferences. You should track down the original sources for a much more thorough and in-depth look at these amazing pieces of plastic, metal, and imagination.
