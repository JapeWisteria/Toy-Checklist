G.I. Joe A Real American Hero
Hasbro. 1982-94. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: 13. Figures: 519.
-----------------------------------------------
Almost all figures have o-ring construction, with a few exceptions. Several figures have action features.

Figures are organized by faction, sub-team, and whether they shipped carded or with vehicles/playsets.

Characters were re-issued often, sometimes with different military specialties, or added to different sub-teams (Rock 'n Roll had 5 different vintage figures, for instance). To track versions, I'm using the versioning information used by yojoe.com.

All figures were released with a file card, listing their names, specialties and biographies. This is listed as an accessory. Details were often changed based on the country the figure was issued in (Rock 'n Roll's birthplace was changed from Malibu, California to Ottawa, Canada, for instance).

From 1983 to 1987, Hasbro re-issued accessories as "Battle Gear" packs...these typically contained all accessories from the previous year's figures in different coloured plastic. If Battle Gear accessories were issued for a figure, it's listed next to the first release of the figure.

All figures in the 1982 release were missing the 'battle grip' point of articulation.
