Star Trek
Playmates. 1992-99. 1:12 Scale (4.5").
Waves: 8. Figures: 259.
-----------------------------------------------
All figures feature solid construction, and were molded in a scale similar to Playmates Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line, but with less exaggerated physiques.

Playmates didn't release figures in traditional waves, instead varying the packaging according to television series or movies. The figures below are listed by year then sub-group. Each year is considered a 'wave'.

In addition, Playmates released many premium figures, exclusives, mail-aways and limited releases. These are listed at the end.

Almost all figures were released with a display stand, and either a trading card or pog. Only the display stand is listed in the accessories.

Figures wearing an outfit that appeared in a single episode or movie have the episode or film listed.

Only 1 figure, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, was not based on a live-action actor, but only appeared in novels.
