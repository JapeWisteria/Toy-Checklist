-----------------------------------------------
Masudaya is a Japanese company known primarily for stamped tin toys, often featuring wind-up action features. In the 1980s they released plastic versions of classic movie and TV robots that are in scale with 3.75" figures. All of them had wind-up walking action.

The figures were re-released in the 1990s with updated packaging, but the figure was the same mold.

All figures feature solid construction, and had no accessories.
