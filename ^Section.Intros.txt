** Star Wars
Kenner produced the iconic vintage series of toys for Star Wars, in multiple scales. Hasbro was given the license in the 1990's and produced a second figure line named Power of the Force, which was received with mixed results from fans. Hasbro has continued to be the main producer of Star Wars figures since.

** Star Trek
Star Trek has not fared well in the 1:18 scale, with only 3 figure lines available in vintage. Playmates would go to great success with a 5" line in the 1990's, and Mego had great success with larger scales in the 1970's, but Star Trek hasn't had much luck with 3.75".

** G.I. Joe A Real American Hero
Along with Star Wars, G.I. Joe dominated the 1980's toy aisles, with hundreds of figures and vehicle sets produced.

** ReAction\Super 7
A recent line started by Funko and taken over by Super 7, ReAction is a throwback to the chunky, limited articulation of the Star Wars line. They produce figures for multiple franchises under the ReAction banner, as well as multiple convention and store exclusive figures, making this line difficult to collect.

Because ReAction loses it's licenses as fast as it gains them, reliable information on the whole toy line is spotty.

** Super Heroes
The 1970's were the last decade in which a toy company could produce both Marvel and DC figures in the same toy line, and Mego made the most of it in multiple scales, including 2 1:18 lines. The 1980's produced the iconic Secret Wars and Super Powers line, in slightly larger scales than 3.75". While DC has seen sporadic figure lines since then, mostly based off the Batman mythos, Hasbro has produced several large lines of Marvel figures in multiple scales. The less said about the Toy Biz years, the better.

** Indiana Jones
There were only 2 meager vintage lines based off Indiana Jones movies, with a larger line by Hasbro decades later that covered all 4 movies.

** Westerns
Time has not been kind to the western genre, but there were still 3 vintage 1:18 lines made for western cartoons and films.

** Fantasy
The science fantasy, action sequences and special effects of Star Wars sparked a flood of both fantasy and science-fiction related movies, television, comics, and more in the 1980's. The success of Dungeons and Dragons helped cement the fantasy genre with a solid toy line, just slightly larger than 1:18 scale.

** Science Fiction
Science fiction came raging back in the late 70's and early 80's, dominating the both the box office and the small screen. Sadly, many of these toy lines didn't expand, as Star Wars sucked all the oxygen out of them before they had a chance to breathe.

** Horror
Vintage horror lines in 3.75" were few and far between, and mainly featured the 'classic' Universal Monster line-up. They were definitely more successful in larger scales. The few figures that exist in smaller scales made up for this with some awesome sculpts.

** Anime
In the 1970's anime stormed North America with, sadly, many heavily-bowdlerized versions of popular shows in Japan. The toy lines were also scatter-shot and underwhelming.

** Gerry Anderson
The king of UK marionation, Gerry Anderson also produced many classic live-action shows, and there is a large sampling of vintage 3.75" toy lines. Sadly missing, however, is Space: 1999.

** Doctor Who


** Film and Television
Not to be left behind in the franchise goldrush of the 80's, many TV shows ended up with 1:18 toy lines as well. Recently, many classic B-movies have also seen small figure assortments released. And, correcting a long-standing injustice to 3.75" aficionados, Steve Austin has joined the ranks of the smaller scale.

** Civilians
A catch-all category for figures made to reflect day-to-day reality. From firefighters to paramedics, reporters to divers, bush pilots to truck drivers, these figures often came with vehicles and play environments allowing children to act out their "dream jobs", and great effort was made to ensure there was both educational as well as play value. These vintage lines were among the first action figures to have appeal in both the boys and girls aisles, and are often fondly remembered by adults.
