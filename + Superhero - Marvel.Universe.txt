Marvel Universe
Hasbro. 2008-2017. 1:18 Scale (3.75").
Waves: ?. Figures: ?.
-----------------------------------------------
Marvel Universe is an umbrella title given to a group of 1:18 scale figures marketed under a variety of names: Fury Files, H.A.M.M.E.R. Files, Marvel Infinite, Marvel Legends, etc. I've marked the title on cardbacks in each wave.

These figures were highly articulated, most came with figure stands and some waves came with promotional items (the Fury Files came with additional "role-play" material). I've only listed the accessories necessary to complete the figure.

Each figure was numbered, and that has been preserved here.

These figures were often re-released in subsequent waves with slightly different paint jobs or accessories. When this happens, I've added a note to the original figure for look-up.

All figures featured solid construction.
